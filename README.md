# Income-Tax-department-Project-15-CSE-326-

This is a web development project clone of Income Tax Department of India, made using HTML, CSS and basic Java Script.
The project was made by observing the original site, breaking the site into modules, understanding the functionality and then reverse engineering.
The project also has some improved CSS in comparison to the original site, as it was a testing ground for things learnt through internet about webdevelopment.
